# Face Detection Using OpenCV's Deep Neural Network (DNN) Module

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCVâ€™s `dnn` module with a pre-trained Caffe model (ResNet-SSD). It uses OpenCVâ€™s deep learning capabilities to detect faces in images and webcam video streams without needing deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
